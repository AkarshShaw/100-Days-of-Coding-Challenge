Exception handling is the process of responding to the occurrence, during computation, of exceptions – anomalous or exceptional conditions requiring special processing – often changing the normal flow of program execution. (Wikipedia)

Java has built-in mechanism to handle exceptions. Using the try statement we can test a block of code for errors. The catch block contains the code that says what to do if exception occurs.

This problem will test your knowledge on try-catch block.

You will be given two integers x and y as input, you have to compute x/y. If x and y are not 32 bit signed integers or if y is zero, exception will occur and you have to report it. Read sample Input/Output to know what to report in case of exceptions.
