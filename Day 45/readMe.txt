Java's BitSet class implements a vector of bit values (i.e.: false(0) or true(1)) that grows as needed, allowing us to easily manipulate bits while optimizing space (when compared to other collections). Any element having a bit value of 1 is called a set bit.

Given 2 BitSets, B1 and B2, of size N where all bits in both BitSets are initialized to 0, perform a series of M operations. After each operation, print the number of set bits in the respective BitSets as two space-separated integers on a new line.
