A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 whose only positive divisors are  and itself. For example, the first six prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Given a large integer, n, use the Java BigInteger class' isProbablePrime method to determine and print whether it's prime or not prime.
